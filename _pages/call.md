## Overview
Both network simulation and extended reality fields use the word ‘Virtual’ but with a different meaning, from Virtualization of computer architectures and networks to immersion into a 3D digital world.
Both these approaches are used for training to cybersecurity, but for different purposes. 
This workshop aims at discussing how the network simulation and XR domains could intricate to enhance training in cybersecurity. Human factor approach as a promising link between them will be considered.

## Workshop topics

–	Cybersecurity
–	XR
–	Human Factors
–	Crisis management
–	Network simulation
–	Virtual Training
Submission Guidelines
Submit a 2 pages paper that will be reviewed in order to allow you to present: 
–	Use cases regarding training in cybersecurity from a network simulation perspective
–	Uses cases about Virtual Environment for Training that could be applied to cybersecurity domain
–	Position paper about the increasing importance of human factors for cybersecurity training
Please send your paper proposal by email to alexandre.kabil@cnrs.fr following the IEEE Computer Society VGTC conference format available at https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/
