## Overview
Both network simulation and extended reality fields use the word ‘Virtual’ but with a different meaning, from Virtualization of computer architectures and networks to immersion into a 3D digital world.

Both these approaches are used for training to cybersecurity, but for different purposes. 

This workshop aims at discussing how the network simulation and XR domains could intricate to enhance training in cybersecurity. Human factor approach as a promising link between them will be considered. For example, terms from cognitive sciences as immersion, presence and situational awareness in the context of strategic and technical cybersecurity virtual training could be discussed. 

Today, cybersecurity training and education, encompassing all aspects from incident to crisis management in response to cyber threats, has shifted from a predominantly military focus to a critical need across public and private organizations of all sectors, sizes, and structures. Over the past decade, various training modalities—including virtual reality, simulation-based training, and augmented reality—have been tailored to build competencies in cyber defence and crisis management. The exploration of these approaches has become fertile ground for interdisciplinary research, yet the rapid expansion of studies in this emerging field, often following distinct paths, presents challenges in consolidating the current knowledge base.

These training modalities are rooted in immersive learning, which draws on experiential learning principles. Key factors in this context such as presence (the sense of "being there"), objective fidelity (physical and functional), and subjective fidelity (sensory and emotional)—play essential roles in supporting knowledge acquisition and retention. Additionally, situational awareness and cognitive effort contribute significantly to the effectiveness of experiential learning in cybersecurity training. Nevertheless, a crucial question remains: how do these factors differ in influencing competency development, knowledge acquisition, and retention when applied across various training modalities? or How the VR & cybersecurity concepts could intricate, as these domains use virtual environments for training, but those environments are totally different ?
For this reason, this workshop target to explore, discuss, and understand the integration of human factors in designing diverse immersive cybersecurity training programs. Specifically, it seeks to study convergence and divergence across different training modalities, ranging from hybrid approaches—such as cyber ranges and augmented reality—to fully virtual environments, such as those enabled by virtual reality.
