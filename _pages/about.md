## Workshop overview

Both network simulation and extended reality fields use the word ‘Virtual’ but with a different meaning, from Virtualization of computer architectures and networks to immersion into a 3D digital world.

Both these approaches are used for training to cybersecurity, but for different purposes. 

This workshop aims to explore, discuss, and understand the integration of human factors  and social science in designing diverse immersive cybersecurity training programs. Specifically, it seeks to study convergence and divergence across different training modalities, ranging from hybrid approaches—such as cyber ranges and augmented reality—to fully virtual environments, such as those enabled by virtual reality.
