## Workshop overview

In cybersecurity training, virtualisation spans simulated computer networks, tabletop crisis management scenarios and fully immersive 3D experiences. Virtualisation is a key concept for human factors and training design as it will determine learners engagement. However, the definition of virtualisation varies across disciplines and scientific research rarely overlap. 

This workshop aims at discussing how the network simulation and XR domains could intricate to enhance training in cybersecurity. Human factor approach as a promising link between them will be considered. For example, terms from cognitive sciences as immersion, presence and situational awareness in the context of strategic and technical cybersecurity virtual training could be discussed.
