## Workshop overview

Both network simulation and extended reality fields use the word ‘Virtual’ but with a different meaning, from Virtualization of computer architectures and networks to immersion into a 3D digital world.

Both these approaches are used for training to cybersecurity, but for different purposes. 

This workshop aims at discussing how the network simulation and XR domains could intricate to enhance training in cybersecurity. Human factor approach as a promising link between them will be considered.
